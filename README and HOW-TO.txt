To use:
Type your dialouge. Two newlines in regular dialogue get converted into a page break. Line scrolls are inserted automatically.

Clicking Convert will automatically put the output onto your clipboard.

String mode is for .inc strings

NPC mode will output a full MSGBOX_NPC eventscript

Sign mode will output a full MSGBOX_SIGN eventscript

Script mode is for regular Poryscript purposes

YesNo will add the if(var(VAR_RESULT) {} block after the output

Dad mode is for celia's stupid romhack; disregard.

Dex mode is for Pokedex text

Move mode is for move descriptions. It starts at the _( so you can easily double click there and drag across the line.

Item mode is for item descriptions. The output starts after the open quotation mark so you can double click the first word of an item description and select the whole line (instead of making you awkwardly select the quotation mark character or the space before it)

Special Characters:

\e becomes é
\. becomes …
$ becomes ¥
\p30 becomes {PAUSE 30} (other integers work too)

\au \ad \ar \al become {UP_ARROW} {DOWN_ARROW} {RIGHT_ARROW} {LEFT_ARROW}
[player] becomes {PLAYER} (for if you're used to HMA's formatting)
